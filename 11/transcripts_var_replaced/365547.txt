we start a for loop from the integer VARIABLE_1 equals NUMBER until as long as VARIABLE_1 is less than strictly less than the FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_0 over NUMBER now if the VARIABLE_1 th character of the VARIABLE_0 unequal to the FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_0 minus NUMBER minus VARIABLE_1 th character VARIABLE_0 we return false and thats the end of the for loop and after we have finished the loop we return true
