FUNCTION_CALL_7 VARIABLE_1 of FUNCTION_CALL_8 VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_8 for VARIABLE_3 is equal to NUMBER VARIABLE_3 is less than VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_8 increment VARIABLE_3 if VARIABLE_3 is not equal to VARIABLE_4 and VARIABLE_3 is not equal to VARIABLE_5 then VARIABLE_1 VARIABLE_3 is VARIABLE_0 VARIABLE_3 else if VARIABLE_3 is equal to VARIABLE_4 then VARIABLE_2 VARIABLE_3 is VARIABLE_0 VARIABLE_5 else VARIABLE_1 VARIABLE_3 is VARIABLE_0 VARIABLE_4 end of for loop return VARIABLE_2
