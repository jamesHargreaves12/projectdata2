create a variable VARIABLE_1 and set it to FUNCTION_CALL_6 of the VARIABLE_0 for VARIABLE_2 in FUNCTION_CALL_7 of VARIABLE_3 for VARIABLE_4 in FUNCTION_CALL_7 of NUMBER to VARIABLE_3 minus VARIABLE_2 minus NUMBER if VARIABLE_0 of VARIABLE_4 is greater than VARIABLE_0 of VARIABLE_4 plus NUMBER do VARIABLE_0 of FUNCTION_CALL_8 VARIABLE_2 VARIABLE_4 VARIABLE_0 VARIABLE_1 the for loop VARIABLE_1 of for loop return VARIABLE_0
