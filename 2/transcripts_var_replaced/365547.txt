so we take a VARIABLE_1 of integers and we store some integer VARIABLE_0 instantiate to NUMBER and now while our VARIABLE_1 is FUNCTION_CALL_3 we check that the FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_1 is bigger than our VARIABLE_0 value if so we set the VARIABLE_0 value to be FUNCTION_CALL_4 of the VARIABLE_1 thats the end of the if statement and so the new VARIABLE_1 is the FUNCTION_CALL_5 of the VARIABLE_1 the end of the for loop
