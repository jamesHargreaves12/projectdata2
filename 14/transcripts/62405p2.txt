define c an array of length of a plus length b set i equals 0 and j equals 0 while i is less than length a or j is less than length b if i is equal to length of a then c of i plus j equals b j increase j by 1 else if j equals length b c open brackets i plus j close brackets is set equal to a i increase i by 1 else if a i is less than b j c open brakets i plus j close brackets is set equal to a i increase i by 1 else c open braket i plus j close brakets equals b j increase j by 1 end if end while
