define a procedure merge sort taking input a an array if the size of  a is 1 then return a end if define l1 as the first half of a a 0 up to a n over to define l2 as the second half of the array a n over 2 plus 1 up to a n applied merge sort  to l 1 and apply merge sort to l2 return merge l1 and l2 end the procedure merge sort defined procedure merge taking inputs a an array and b an array define c an array of length of a plus length b set i equals 0 and j equals 0 while i is less than length a or j is less than length b if i is equal to length of a then c of i plus j equals b j increase j by 1 else if j equals length b c open brackets i plus j close brackets equals a is set equal to a i increase i by 1 else if a i is less than b j c open brakets i+j close brackets is set equal to a i increase i by 1 else c open braket i plus j close brakets  equals b j increase j by 1 end if end while end procedure merge
