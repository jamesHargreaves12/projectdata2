we take a list of integers input then if the length of the list is smaller than equal to 1 we simply return the list now we compute some middle value which the length to list divided by 2 and then we before merge short on left half which is the 0  th element of the list until the middle element minus 1 we merge the right half the list which is the middle element in the list until the length of the list minus 1 element and then we merge these 2 lists using a merge function
the merge function takes a left and the right list and while both are not empty we check which 1 is smaller if the left lists first element smaller than the right lists first element we append to left list first element to some results list and now we let the left list we removed the first item from left list if it was not the case so the head of the right list is bigger smaller than that of the first list then we append the first elements of the right list to results and let the right list be the tail the right list once that while loop is finished so either 1 of them is empty then we make sure the other 1s the both them are empty so while the left list is not empty we add all of them and then while list right lists not empty we add all of them and thats the merge function
