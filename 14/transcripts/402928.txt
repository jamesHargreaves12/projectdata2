if length of the array is greater than 1 number to mid is equal to length of the array left is equal to slice of array from start to mid and right is equal to a slice of array from mid to end we call merge sort on left and then we call merge sort on right then we set i is equal to j is equal to k is equal to 0 and while i is less than length of left and j less than length of right we do if left of i is less than right of j we set  array of k too left of i and we increment i by 1 else we set array of k to right of j and we increment j by 1 and then increment k by 1 end of while loop another while loop while i is less than length of l array of k is equal to left of i and we increment i and k end of while loop while j is less than length of right we set array of k to right of j we increment j and k end of while loop
