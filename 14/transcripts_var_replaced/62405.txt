if the FUNCTION_CALL_5 of VARIABLE_2 is NUMBER then return VARIABLE_2 end if define VARIABLE_0 as VARIABLE_2 NUMBER up to VARIABLE_2 VARIABLE_3 over NUMBER define VARIABLE_1 as VARIABLE_2 VARIABLE_3 over NUMBER plus NUMBER up to VARIABLE_2 VARIABLE_3 applied FUNCTION_CALL_6 to VARIABLE_0 and apply FUNCTION_CALL_6 to VARIABLE_1 return FUNCTION_CALL_7 VARIABLE_0 and VARIABLE_1
