while VARIABLE_2 and VARIABLE_1 are FUNCTION_CALL_4 if the VARIABLE_2 lists FUNCTION_CALL_5 smaller than the VARIABLE_1 lists FUNCTION_CALL_5 we FUNCTION_CALL_6 to VARIABLE_2 list FUNCTION_CALL_5 to some VARIABLE_0 list and now we removed the first item from VARIABLE_2 list if it was not the case then we FUNCTION_CALL_6 the first elements of the VARIABLE_1 list to VARIABLE_0 and let the VARIABLE_1 list be the FUNCTION_CALL_8 the VARIABLE_1 list once that while loop is finished while the VARIABLE_2 list is FUNCTION_CALL_4 we FUNCTION_CALL_9 of them and then while list VARIABLE_1 lists FUNCTION_CALL_4 we FUNCTION_CALL_9 of them
