if the FUNCTION_CALL_3 of the VARIABLE_1 is smaller than equal to NUMBER we simply return the VARIABLE_1 now we compute some VARIABLE_0 value which the FUNCTION_CALL_3 to VARIABLE_1 divided by NUMBER and then we before FUNCTION_CALL_5 sort on left half which is the NUMBER th element of the VARIABLE_1 until the VARIABLE_0 element minus NUMBER we FUNCTION_CALL_5 the right half the VARIABLE_1 which is the VARIABLE_0 element in the VARIABLE_1 until the FUNCTION_CALL_3 of the VARIABLE_1 minus NUMBER element
