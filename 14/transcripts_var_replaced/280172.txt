set list VARIABLE_0 to an empty list set VARIABLE_1 to NUMBER set VARIABLE_2 to NUMBER while VARIABLE_1 is smaller than the FUNCTION_CALL_6 of list VARIABLE_3 and VARIABLE_2 is smaller than the FUNCTION_CALL_6 of list VARIABLE_4 if list VARIABLE_3 indexed at VARIABLE_1 is smaller than list VARIABLE_4 indexed at VARIABLE_2 FUNCTION_CALL_7 to VARIABLE_0 list VARIABLE_3 index to VARIABLE_1 increment VARIABLE_1 else FUNCTION_CALL_7 to lists VARIABLE_0 list VARIABLE_4 indexed at VARIABLE_2 increment VARIABLE_2 end of the while loop if the FUNCTION_CALL_6 of list VARIABLE_3 is greater than NUMBER FUNCTION_CALL_7 to list VARIABLE_0 all of list VARIABLE_3 FUNCTION_CALL_8 VARIABLE_1 end if statement if the FUNCTION_CALL_6 of list VARIABLE_4 is greater than NUMBER FUNCTION_CALL_7 to list VARIABLE_0 all of list VARIABLE_4 FUNCTION_CALL_8 VARIABLE_2
