if FUNCTION_CALL_10 of the VARIABLE_1 is greater than NUMBER number VARIABLE_0 is equal to FUNCTION_CALL_10 of the VARIABLE_1 VARIABLE_3 is equal to slice of VARIABLE_1 from start VARIABLE_0 and VARIABLE_2 is equal to a slice of VARIABLE_1 from VARIABLE_4 to end we call FUNCTION_CALL_11 on VARIABLE_3 and then we call FUNCTION_CALL_11 on VARIABLE_2 then we set VARIABLE_5 is equal to VARIABLE_6 is equal to VARIABLE_7 is equal to NUMBER and while VARIABLE_5 is less than FUNCTION_CALL_10 of VARIABLE_3 and VARIABLE_6 less than FUNCTION_CALL_10 of VARIABLE_2 we do if VARIABLE_3 of VARIABLE_5 is less than VARIABLE_2 of VARIABLE_6 we set VARIABLE_1 of VARIABLE_7 too VARIABLE_3 of VARIABLE_5 and we increment VARIABLE_5 by NUMBER else we set VARIABLE_1 of VARIABLE_7 to VARIABLE_2 of VARIABLE_6 and we increment VARIABLE_6 by NUMBER and then increment VARIABLE_7 by NUMBER end of while loop another while loop while VARIABLE_5 is less than FUNCTION_CALL_10 of VARIABLE_8 VARIABLE_1 of VARIABLE_7 is equal to VARIABLE_3 of VARIABLE_5 and we increment VARIABLE_5 and VARIABLE_7 end of while loop while VARIABLE_6 is less than FUNCTION_CALL_10 of VARIABLE_2 we set VARIABLE_1 of VARIABLE_7 to VARIABLE_2 of VARIABLE_6 we increment VARIABLE_6 and VARIABLE_7 end of while loop
