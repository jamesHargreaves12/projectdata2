for each VARIABLE_1 from NUMBER to NUMBER inclusive set VARIABLE_0 to the STRING_CONST if VARIABLE_1 is a FUNCTION_CALL_4 of NUMBER add STRING_CONST to VARIABLE_0 if VARIABLE_1 is a FUNCTION_CALL_4 of NUMBER add STRING_CONST to VARIABLE_0 if VARIABLE_1 is neither a FUNCTION_CALL_4 of NUMBER nor FUNCTION_CALL_4 of NUMBER add VARIABLE_1 to VARIABLE_0 FUNCTION_CALL_6 VARIABLE_0 end the for loop
